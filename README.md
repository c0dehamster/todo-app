## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Add new todos to the list
-   Mark todos as complete
-   Delete todos from the list
-   Filter by all/active/complete todos
-   Clear all completed todos
-   Toggle light and dark mode
-   **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS framework
-   Typescript
-   [svelte-dnd-action](https://github.com/isaacHagoel/svelte-dnd-action) - a library for creating drag and drop components for Svelte using a custom action

### What I learned

### Continued development

### Useful resources

-   [Drag and drop with Svelte using svelte-dnd-action](https://dev.to/isaachagoel/drag-and-drop-with-svelte-using-svelte-dnd-action-4554) - An article about making a drag-and-drop list with svelte-dnd-action writtem by the author of the library

-   [SvelteKit Drag And Drop List With svelte-dnd-action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFX525V3dMs) - This video was useful for figuring out how to use the library with typescript
